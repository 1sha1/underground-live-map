underground-live-map
====================

http://traintimes.org.uk/map/tube/

This uses the TfL API to plot the approximate live locations of
all the trains on the London Underground.

It is very hacky. Built on top of many-years-old code, with
many hacks to get things working. But here it is anyway. Feel
free to improve, it shouldn't be hard!
